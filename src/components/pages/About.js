        Hi! My name is Asad Ansari. I am currently 25 years old and live in Upper Darby, PA. I graduated from Drexel in 2019 with a degree in math and philosophy. After that I went to law school and completed my first two years of law school at Temple Law. Currently I am on a leave of absence from law school and am exploring a career shift into the software field!
        To this end I completed the Penn LPS Full Stack coding bootcamp. There I focused on gaining technical programming skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handelbars.js, and ReactJS. I look forward to using these skills and expanding them further in the workplace.
